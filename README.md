<h1>Decentralized Prediction Markets</h1>
Decentralized Prediction Markets (DPM) is my ambitious project to create a censorship-resistant marketplace. This is possible because, unlike most marketplaces, the end product of a prediction market (PM) is information. Bitcoin adds the second piece of the puzzle: the exchange of value.

Contract outcomes are determined by a weighted vote based on present and past consensus with (theoretically) a unique Nash Equilibrium where all voters place 'open contracts' (contracts for events that have already happened) into the correct state, and only contracts anticipated to generate sufficiently-high transaction volume are created at all. Additionally, market liquidity (a frequent problem on sites such as InTrade.com) is guaranteed to be infinite thanks to the LMSR, an invention of Dr. Robin Hanson.

<h2>Directory</h2>
Code is generally in the 'lib' folder, other items generally in the 'docs' folder.

<h2>Target Schedule</h2>
Everything is a work in progress!<br />
December 15th, 2013: Publish "Consensus Mechanism" + Tests in R, and writeup of this 'Oracle' function and its purpose.<br />
December 20th, 2013: Publish "Market Maker" + Tests in R, and writeup of how trading will occur.<br />
January 1st, 2014: Publish the conceptualization for how to modify ZeroCoin to enable 'locking' coins with the MarketMaker.<br />
March 1st: Rewrite everything in Python, a more popular and powerful language.<br />
March 2nd: Get lots of help from experienced developers who understand the Bitcoin software code.<br />

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Does this compete with Bitcoin as a store of value?</h3>
No!  Truthcoins represent voting power within this system, and you use them to earn Bitcoins. So they are more similar to shares of a traded corporation. This system accepts and dispenses Bitcoin as its store of value.

<h3>If you have votes, how do you know that people wont just lie and claim the outcome was whatever will benefit them personally?</h3>
This is a little complicated to explain, but I am working on it (the explanation). The code/function library that does it is already finished! Check it out!

<h3>How can you have a non-theft market unless you wait for 6 confirmations? Doesn't it take about an hour to lock in a Bitcoin transaction? How can you have a functional marketplace if every transaction takes that long?</h3>
Look at this: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts#Example_7:_Rapidly-adjusted_.28micro.29payments_to_a_pre-determined_party

<h3>Prediction markets are a waste of time because no one uses them, drying up the liquidity and punishing the few who dared to try to make the market work.</h3>
No! The liquidity problem has been solved, even if the solution is widely ignored: http://hanson.gmu.edu/mktscore.pdf
I threw together an Excel sheet in the docs folder for additional clarification.
