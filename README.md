<h1>Decentralized Prediction Markets</h1>
Decentralized Prediction Markets (DPM) is my ambitious project to create a censorship-resistant marketplace. This is possible because, unlike most marketplaces, the end product of a prediction market (PM) is information. Bitcoin adds the second piece of the puzzle: the exchange of value.

Contract outcomes are determined by a weighted vote based on present and past consensus with (theoretically) a unique Nash Equilibrium where all voters place 'open contracts' (contracts for events that have already happened) into the correct state, and only contracts anticipated to generate sufficiently-high transaction volume are created at all. Additionally, market liquidity (a frequent problem on sites such as InTrade.com) is guaranteed to be infinite thanks to the LMSR, an invention of Dr. Robin Hanson.

<h2>Target Schedule</h2>
Everything is a work in progress!<br />
December 15th, 2013: Publish "Consensus Mechanism" + Tests in R, and writeup of this 'Oracle' function and its purpose.<br />
December 20th, 2013: Publish "Market Maker" + Tests in R, and writeup of how trading will occur.<br />
January 1st, 2014: Publish the conceptualization for how to modify ZeroCoin to enable 'locking' coins with the MarketMaker.<br />
March 1st: Rewrite everything in Python, a more popular and powerful language.<br />
March 2nd: Get lots of help from experienced developers who understand the Bitcoin software code.<br />
 
<h2>Note</h2>
Please leave feedback! I am new to managing a GitHub project and you will not hurt my feelings.
