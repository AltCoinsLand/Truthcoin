<h1>Truthcoin: Decentralized Bitcoin Prediction Markets</h1>
Decentralized Bitcoin Prediction Markets (DBPM) is my ambitious project to create a censorship-resistant marketplace. This is possible because, unlike most marketplaces, the end product of a prediction market (PM) is information. Bitcoin adds the second piece of the puzzle: the exchange of value.

Contract outcomes are determined by a weighted vote based on present and past consensus with (theoretically) a unique Nash Equilibrium where all voters place 'open contracts' (contracts for events that have already happened) into the correct state, and only contracts anticipated to generate sufficiently-high transaction volume are created at all. Additionally, market liquidity (a frequent problem on sites such as InTrade.com) is guaranteed to be infinite thanks to the LMSR, an invention of Dr. Robin Hanson.

<h2>Directory</h2>
Code is generally in the 'lib' folder, other items generally in the 'docs' folder. The 'lib' folder also has html files which describe the outcome of function tests and demonstrations. These files were automatically generated from R code using R-markdown, and the .rmd files are included alongside the html files for reproducibility.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Does this compete with Bitcoin as a store of value?</h3>
No!  Truthcoins represent voting power within this system, and you use them to earn Bitcoins. So they are more similar to shares of a traded corporation. This system accepts and dispenses Bitcoin as its store of value.

<h3>If you have votes, how do you know that people wont just lie and claim the outcome was whatever will benefit them personally?</h3>
Check 'voting strategy' in the Whitepaper (docs folder). The code/function library that does it has been finished.
Abstract. Where Bitcoin allows for the decentralized exchange of value, this paper addresses the decentralized creation and administration of Prediction Markets (PMs). An alternative proof-of-work blockchain collects information on the creation and state of PMs, with the winning state of a market determined by a modified weighted-vote. An incentive mechanism attempts to guarantee a) that all voters vote honestly, and b) that PM-creators act as entrepreneurs, bearing the economic costs and benefits of the PMs they create. Bitcoin users can create PMs on any subject, or trade anonymously within any PM, and all PMs enjoy low fees and infinite market liquidity through a LMSR market maker. Scalability and customizability can be achieved via ‘branching’ (controlled-fork). The paper closes with a discussion of implementation details.


<h3>Prediction markets are a waste of time because no one uses them, drying up the liquidity and punishing the few who dared to try to make the market work.</h3>
The liquidity problem has been solved, even if the solution is widely ignored: http://hanson.gmu.edu/mktscore.pdf
I threw together an Excel sheet in the docs folder for additional clarification.
