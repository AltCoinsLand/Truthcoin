The version I finished is in R/S+, I realize that Python is faster/flexible/popular and I'm rewriting it in Python now but it isn't at all finished.
When I work in Windows, I am using WinPython-64bit-3.3.3.3 which comes with numpy and others. It is free so if you use windows and can't follow my work I recommend you install that and run Spyder.
