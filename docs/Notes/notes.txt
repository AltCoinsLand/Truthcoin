Encouraging an Honest Consensus

I
fear it will require more effort than I alone
can muster to make it real. It may well be
that if you don't do it, no one will; what do
you say?
There are many options for pursuing
idea futures. I have worked to gain the at-
tention of "science policy" academics
[Han92], and idea futures will soon be a
known, if oddball, suggested alternative
mechanism for science funding. I have
mostly developed a board game and to a
lesser extent an email reputation game.
Legal research is probably the most impor-
tant task, but it is on hold for a lack of
funds
