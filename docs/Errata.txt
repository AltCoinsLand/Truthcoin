For Truthcoin 1.2:

As currently programmed, adding a market requires a hash, quantity of states, payment (as stated), but also information about the dimentionality of states (1x4 is different from 2x2).

Someone has pointed out that agents could simply avoid voting. This is strongly discouraged in the code through the (original) use of 'participation', but I forgot to write about it in the RBCR section of the paper.

Someone requested more explanation wrt to the timeline of a market, may require visual aid as it is so crucial.
