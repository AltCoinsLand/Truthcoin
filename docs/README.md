[Truthcoin_1.1.pdf](https://github.com/psztorc/Truthcoin/raw/master/docs/Truthcoin_1.1.pdf) - My whitepaper describing a software protocol which creates and manages decentralized prediction markets (PMs).  

Other papers which describe the overall purposes and goals of this endeavour:  

1. [What PMs are and why they're important.](https://github.com/psztorc/Truthcoin/raw/master/docs/1_Purpose.pdf)  
2. [How PMs can be assembled into different types (for maximum impact).](https://github.com/psztorc/Truthcoin/raw/master/docs/2_PM_Types.pdf)  
3. [How PMs can be used in ways other than simply predicting the future.](https://github.com/psztorc/Truthcoin/raw/master/docs/3_PM_Applications.pdf)  
4. [Some myths about PMs which I still hear.](https://github.com/psztorc/Truthcoin/raw/master/docs/4_PM_Myths.pdf)  
5. [A comment on PM-manipulation and why it actually is helpful (by providing profit opportunities).](https://github.com/psztorc/Truthcoin/raw/master/docs/5_PM_Manipulation.pdf)


FAQ
------------------------------------------

### Basics / Project Scope

#### What does this project aim to accomplish?
Traditional PMs have many problems:  
1. Counterparty risk (must trust whoever is holding the money to use it as promised). CR is why one can't make bets with certain friends.  
2. The trustworthy PM-administrator must (coincidentally) share your taste in PM topics.  
3. The PM-administrator would have to be expected to provide service for a length of time (and not be interrupted by an executive's death or regulatory interference).  
4. PM-administrator would have to offer competitive prices, be economically viable, not go out of business, etc.  
This project aims to solve all of these problems.

### Incentives
#### How do you know that people wont claim an outcome was whatever will benefit them personally?
Check 'voting strategy' in the Whitepaper (docs folder). The code/function library which prevents this has been finished in both R and Python flavors.


#### Prediction markets are a waste of time because no one uses them, drying up the liquidity and punishing the few who dared to try to make the market work.
The liquidity problem has been solved, even if the solution is widely ignored: http://hanson.gmu.edu/mktscore.pdf
I threw together an Excel sheet in the docs folder [LogMSR_Demo.xlsx](https://github.com/psztorc/Truthcoin/raw/master/docs/LogMSR_Demo.xlsx) for additional clarification. Feedback is appreciated.
