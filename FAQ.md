<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>Does this compete with Bitcoin as a store of value?</h2>
No!  Truthcoins represent voting power within this system, and you use them to earn Bitcoins. So they are more similar to shares of a traded corporation. This system accepts and dispenses Bitcoin as its store of value.

<h2>If you have votes, how do you know that people wont just lie and claim the outcome was whatever will benefit them personally?</h2>

<h2>How can you have a non-theft market unless you wait for 6 confirmations? Doesn't it take about an hour to lock in a Bitcoin transaction? How can you have a functional marketplace if every transaction takes that long?</h2>

<h2>Prediction markets are a waste of time because no one uses them, drying up the liquidity and punishing the few who dared to try to make the market work.</h2>
